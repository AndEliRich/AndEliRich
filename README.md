- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndEliRich
- 👀 I’m interested in Obsidian, Nightscout, DIYLoop, DIYAPS, and all tech for people like myself living with type 1 diabetes. #WEARENOTWAITING.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Obsidian and how to maximize this tool as a knowledge management app. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really because I don't know how to develop. I just how how to grab awesome code that other people make!
